# drWhoAPI

Making a basic Doctor Who API with a view to demoing a version of Letterboxd for Doctor Who stories. 

I started off making a Spring Boot template [here](https://start.spring.io/) and then building up the classes in Java using IntelliJ. The plan is to make a simple version of the API to begin with and then add more complicated relationships, replacing Strings with other instances of entities.
